Always remember, that each time you write a script with a pencil and paper, it becomes imprinted so deeply in memory that the material and methods are learned extremely well. When you Type the scripts, the same is true. The more you type and write out the scripts by keyboard or pencil and paper, the more you will learn programming!
Write and Type EVERY example that you find.
Keep all of your scripts organized.
Every script that you create increases your programming abilities.
SEEING CODE, is one thing,
but WRITING CODE is another.
Write it, Type it, Speak it, See it, Dream it.
