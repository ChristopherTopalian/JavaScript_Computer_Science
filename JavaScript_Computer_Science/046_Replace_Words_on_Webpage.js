/*

/ beginning and ending slashes show the start and end of the regular expression pattern.

g means global and it replaces all occurrences of the pattern, not only the first one.

i means case insensitive, meaning it matches uppercase and lowercase of the found pattern.

\b(?:News)\b The regular expression pattern being searched for

\b word boundary anchor means that the pattern is matched only as a whole word but not as part of a bigger word.

(?:News) This is a non-capturing group that matches the word "News." The ?: at the beginning of the group makes it non-capturing, which means it won't be found as part of a match.

\b word boundary anchor ensures the whole word is matched.
